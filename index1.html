<h1>EQUALITY RIGHTS (ARTICLES 14 – 18)</h1>
<p>
1.1 Article 14 of the Constitution of India reads as under:
“The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal
protection of the laws within the territory of India.”</p>
<p>1.2 The said Article is clearly in two parts – while it commands the State not to deny
to any person ‘equality before law’, it also commands the State not to deny the
‘equal protection of the laws’. Equality before law prohibits discrimination. It is a
negative concept. The concept of ‘equal protection of the laws’ requires the State
to give special treatment to persons in different situations in order to establish
equality amongst all. It is positive in character. Therefore, the necessary
corollary to this would be that equals would be treated equally, whilst un-equals
would have to be treated unequally</p>
<p>Article 15 secures the citizens from every sort of discrimination by the State, on the
grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth or any of them. However,
this Article does not prevent the State from making any special provisions for
women or children. Further, it also allows the State to extend special provisions
for socially and economically backward classes for their advancement. It applies
to the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) as well.</p>
<p>Article 16 assures equality of opportunity in matters of public employment and
prevents the State from any sort of discrimination on the grounds of religion,
race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them. This Article
also provides the autonomy to the State to grant special provisions for the
backward classes, under-represented States, SC & ST for posts under the State.
Local candidates may also be given preference is certain posts. Reservation of
posts for people of a certain religion or denomination in a religious or
denominational institution will not be deemed illegal.</p>
<p>1.3 Articles 14, 15 and 16 form part of a scheme of the Constitutional Right to
Equality. Article 15 and 16 are incidents of guarantees of Equality, and give effect
to Article 14. However, initially, Articles 15(4) and 16(4) were considered
exceptions to Articles 15(1) and 16(1).</p>
<p>1.4 The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in G.M. Southern Railways v. Rangachari, AIR
1962 SC 36 held Article 15(4) of the Constitution of India to be an exception to
Article 15(1). The relevant portion is reproduced hereunder:
“Article 15(4) which provides, inter alia, for an exception to the
prohibition of discrimination on grounds specified in Article 15(1) lays
down that nothing contained in the said Article shall prevent the State
2
from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially
and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled
Castes and the Scheduled Tribes”</p>
<p>1.5 It was further held that Article 16(4) is an exception to Article 16(1):
“I have already said that it is implicit in the Article that reservation
cannot be of all appointments or even of a majority of them, for that
would completely destroy the fundamental right enshrined in Article
16(1) to which Article 16(4) is in the nature of a proviso or an exception or
at any rate make it practically illusory.”</p>
<p>1.6 In M.R. Balaji v. State of Mysore, AIR 1963 SC 649, this view was followed, and
it was held that:
“Thus, there is no doubt that Article 15(4) has to be read as a proviso or
an exception to Articles 15(1) and 29(2).”</p>
<p>1.7 This view, that Articles 15(4) and 16(4) were exceptions to Articles 15(1) and
16(1), was again reiterated in Triloki Nath v. State of Jammu and Kashmir, AIR
1969 SC 1, and in State of A.P. v. U.S.V. Balram, (1972) 1 SCC 660.</p>
<p>1.8 The majority of a 7-Judge Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, in State of
Kerala v. N.M. Thomas, (1976) 2 SCC 310, introduced a change in the concept of
equality. It held that Articles 14, 15, and 16 are all equality rights, and that the
scheme of equality sought to achieve real equality. It was held that Articles 15(4)
and Article 16(4) are not exceptions to Articles 15(1) and 16(1) respectively. The
relevant portions of the majority judgments are reproduced hereunder:
Ray, C.J.</p>
<p>37. Article 16(4) clarifies and explains that classification on the basis of
backwardness does not fall within Article 16(2) and is legitimate for the
purposes of Article 16(1). If preference shall be given to a particular
under-represented community other than a backward class or underrepresented State in an all-India service such a rule will contravene
Article 16(2). A similar rule giving preference to an under-represented
backward community is valid and will not contravene Articles 14, 16(1)
and 16(2). Article 16(4) removes any doubt in this respect.
Mathew, J</p>
<p>78. I agree that Article 16(4) is capable of being interpreted as an
exception to Article 16(1) if the equality of opportunity visualized in
Article 16(1) is a sterile one, geared to the concept of numerical equality
which takes no account of the social, economic, educational background
of the members of Scheduled Castes and scheduled tribes. If equality of
opportunity guaranteed under Article 16(1) means effective material
equality, then Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1). It is only
an emphatic way of putting the extent to which equality of opportunity
could be carried viz., even up to the point of making reservation.
Krishna Iyer, J

<p>“136. The next hurdle in the appellant’s path relates to Article 16(4). To
my mind, this sub-article serves not as an exception but as an emphatic
statement, one mode of reconciling the claims of backward people and
the opportunity for free competition the forward sections are ordinarily
entitled to…
Fazal Ali, J
184. … Clause (4) of Article 16 of the Constitution cannot be read in
isolation but has to be read as part and parcel of Article 16(1) and (2).
...That is to say clause (4) of Article 16 is not an exception to Article 14 in
the sense that whatever classification can be made can be done only
through clause (4) of Article 16. Clause (4) of Article 16, however, is an
explanation containing an exhaustive and exclusive provision regarding
reservation which is one of the forms of classification.
...It is true that there are some authorities of this Court that clause (4) is an
exception to Article 16(1) but with due respect I am not in a position to
subscribe to this view for the reasons that I shall give hereafter.</p>
<p>1.9 A 9-Judge Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court settled this issue in Indra
Sawhney v. Union of India, 1992 (Supp) 3 SCC 217, where the majority upheld
the principle laid down in Thomas’ case that Articles 15(4) and 16(4) were not
exceptions to Articles 15(1) and 16(1), but were an emphatic statement of
equality.</p>
<p>1.10 Therefore, equality, as guaranteed in our Constitution, not only conceives of
providing formal equality but also to provide for real and absolute equality.
Articles 14 and 15(1) enable and contemplate classification to achieve the
Constitutional Objective of real equality. Articles 15(4) and 16(4) flow out of
Articles 15(1) and 16(1) respectively, and can never be considered as exceptions
to Article 15(1) and Article 16(1).</p>
<p>1.11 Once this is established, that Article 15(4) and 16(4) are not exceptions to the
mandate of equality but are concrete measures to bring about the mandate of
equality enshrined in Article 14, the effect of this is that the State is obliged to
remove inequalities and backwardness. This obligation of the State has its source
in the mandate of equality itself under Article 14.</p>
<p>1.12 In Thomas’ case, it was held that Government has an affirmative duty to eliminate
inequalities and to provide opportunities for the exercise of human rights and
claims Fundamental rights as enacted in Part III of the Constitution are, by and
large, essentially negative in character. In Indira Sawhney’s case, Sawant, J
concurring with the majority observed that to bring about equality between the
unequals, it was necessary to adopt positive measures to abolish inequality. The
equalising measures would have to use the same tools by which inequality was
4
introduced and perpetuated. Otherwise, equalisation will not be of the unequals.
These equalising measures would be validated by Article 14 which guarantees
equality before law</p>
